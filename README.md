# Ship Game

This is a 2D ship game created using the Bevy game engine in Rust. The player controls a ship with arrow keys for movement (front, back, sides) and mouse clicks for turning. Power can be increased by pressing the arrow keys twice, allowing the ship to move faster.

## Features
- Arrow key movement in four directions (up, down, left, right).
- Double arrow key press to double the movement power.
- Mouse clicks to control the ship’s turning.
- Simple setup with Bevy’s ECS architecture.

## Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Move the ship in different directions.
  - Press an arrow key once to move at normal speed.
  - Press the same arrow key twice quickly to double the movement power.
- **Mouse Click**: Left-click to rotate the ship toward a point.
